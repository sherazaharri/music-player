# Sheraza's Music Player
**A fully responsive, React-based personal music player!** 
This project was made with the purpose of deepening my understanding of React, state management, and responsive UI design while creating a polished, real-world application.

## 🛠️ Techonologies
- **React** (Functional Components)
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
  * Flexbox
  * Media Queries
* **Netlify** (Deployment)

## ✨ Features
- **Music Player**
  - Displays current song information
  - Interactive progress bar with realtime updates
  - Playback Controls: Previous, Next, Play, and Pause buttons
  - Adjustable volume slider alongside a mute button

- **Playlist Sidebar**
  - Full list displaying all of the available songs
  - Click-to-play song selection

- **A Fully responsive site, compatible with any type of device**

## 📚 What I Learned
- **React Hooks and when to use them**
    - `useState()` for state management
    - `useEffect()` for syncing UI with playback state
    - `useContext()` for sharing state across components
    - `useRef()` for audio and DOM control
 
- **Data Rendering**
  - Converted a JavaScript file containing an array of song objects into dynamically rendered and  fully interactable buttons as seen on the playlist sidebar

- **HTML DOM's and Media Handling**
  - Gained a hands-on experience with HTML audio elements and DOM properties
  - Controlled playback, timing, volume, and progress programmatically

- **Layout and Styling**
  - Deepened understanding of CSS Flexbox through creating a complex layout
  - Used the Position property, like relative and absolute, to implement the overlapping sidebar for smaller screens

- **Responsive Design**
  - Created a multitude of media queries to ensure a smooth experience for all devices

- **JavaScript Practice**
  - Strengthened core JavaScript skills through extensive problem solving and event handling

## Future Improvements
A list of features I want to implement in the future
- **Sidebar opening and closing animation**
- **Making the progress bar fill up, similar to a loading bar**
- **The ability to add new songs by uploading files to the site**
